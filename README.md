[GridLayoutByRole][] is a [Grid][] layout plugin that groups roster members by role.

[GridLayoutByRole][] adds two new layouts "By Role" and "By Role w/Pets" to the [Grid][] Layout tab.
The roles are determined automatically based on a unit's class and specialization, but are overridden by the Blizzard party/raid roles.
