Overview
--------

[GridLayoutByRole][project] is a [Grid][] layout plugin that groups members into raid roles as _tanks_, _melee DPS_, _healers_, and _ranged DPS_.  This layout is useful for certain types of healing spells that affect other players near the player on which the heal is cast, e.g, [Chain Heal][], [Power Word: Radiance][], [Wild Growth][], etc.

Features
--------

+ Adds a new layout _By Raid Role_ to the __Grid__ _Layout_ tab.
+ Roles are determined automatically based on a unit's class and specialization.
+ The roster is sorted into four role groups from left to right: _tanks_, _melee DPS_, _healers_, and _ranged DPS_.
+ Each of the groups can be assigned to any of the four roles.
+ Certain healing classes can be optionally sorted with the _melee DPS_ role group.
+ Optionally allow Blizzard-assigned roles to take precedence over the specialization roles.
