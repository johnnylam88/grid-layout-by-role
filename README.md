[GridLayoutByRole][] is a [Grid][] layout plugin that groups members into raid roles as _tanks_, _melee DPS_, _healers_, and _ranged DPS_.

[GridLayoutByRole][] adds a new layout "By Raid Role" to the [Grid][] Layout tab.

The roster is sorted into groups from left to right: _tanks_, _melee DPS_, _healers_, _ranged DPS_ and an optional _pets_ group.  The roles are determined automatically based on a unit's class and specialization, but are overridden by the Blizzard party/raid roles.
